What we need to continue to wire:
fastapi
uvicorn[standard]
pydantic
tensorflow



AND THEN WE DO THIS: 

1) Live Pulse (UI + API), no websockets

Contract

GET /pulse/snapshot → current EVI + top emotions (JSON)

GET /pulse/stream → SSE (Server-Sent Events) emitting { evi, emotions, sample, ts } every 2–5s

Backend (drop into your /ask service or a tiny “pulse-api”)

# FastAPI SSE example (no sockets)
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request
from fastapi.responses import StreamingResponse
import asyncio, json, time

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/pulse/snapshot")
def snapshot():
    return current_pulse()  # implement to read from Redis/DB/in-memory cache

@app.get("/pulse/stream")
async def stream(request: Request):
    async def gen():
        while True:
            if await request.is_disconnected(): break
            data = current_pulse()  # {"evi": 64, "emotions":{"anticipation":0.31,...}, "sample":1272, "ts":int(time.time())}
            yield f"data: {json.dumps(data)}\n\n"
            await asyncio.sleep(2)
    return StreamingResponse(gen(), media_type="text/event-stream")

useEffect(() => {
  const base = import.meta.env.VITE_INTEL_API_URL!;
  const es = new EventSource(`${base.replace(/\/+$/,'')}/pulse/stream`, { withCredentials:false });
  es.onmessage = (ev) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(ev.data);
    setEvi(data.evi); setEmotions(data.emotions); setSample(data.sample);
  };
  es.onerror = () => es.close();
  return () => es.close();
}, []);

2) Ingestion → EVI (Emotional Volatility Index)

Ingest (keep it boring & durable)

Pull: your existing scrapers / Apify / API pulls drop JSON to s3://sentientiq-raw-data/social/{source}/{yyyy}/{mm}/{dd}/... .json

Normalize (Lambda or tiny “ingester” container) → write Parquet to
s3://sentientiq-processed-data/social/{dt=YYYY-MM-DD}/{source}/part-*.parquet

Catalog with AWS Glue (Athena reads it instantly)

EVI Aggregator (lightweight worker)

Every 15–60s: read last N minutes of processed posts (Athena / or a small Kinesis-less “tailer” if you prefer)

Run your emotion model → produce counts/weights

Compute EVI = normalized volatility of emotion vector over a short window (e.g., std-dev of top-k emotions vs trailing baseline)

Cache current pulse in Redis (or in-process if single instance)

Also append a time series row to s3://sentientiq-data-moat/evi/{brand}/{dt} as Parquet for down-the-line analytics


3) Make it a moat, not a moment

Your deck already names the moat assets; let’s store them explicitly so they accrete value every day:

Moat datasets (S3 paths & what they represent)

Emotional Fingerprints of campaigns/content
s3://sentientiq-data-moat/fingerprints/{brand}/{campaign}/{content_id}/…

Authenticity Trends (human vs synthetic)
s3://sentientiq-data-moat/authenticity/{brand}/{dt}/…

Agent Consensus Logs (debate decisions & dissent)
s3://sentientiq-data-moat/consensus/{dt}/...

AI Interaction Responses (how people react to AI-driven actions)
s3://sentientiq-data-moat/responses/{brand}/{dt}/…

EVI Time Series (“ticker”)
s3://sentientiq-data-moat/evi/{brand}/{dt}/…

These are the exact categories you pitch as the moat and the asset class: emotional fingerprints, authenticity scores over time, swarm consensus logs, emotional responses, and the EVI “radar”. The longer it runs, the deeper the moat. 


4. WE HAVE THIS:   

sentientiq-raw-data
sentientiq-processed-data
sentientiq-data-lake
sentientiq-data-moat
sentientiq-ml-<id>


LET'S USE IT:

raw → processed → moat (Parquet, partitioned by date/source/brand)

Keep models in sentientiq-ml-* (TF or ONNX). Fetch on boot; cache locally; reload on MODEL_VERSION change.

Athena sits over processed+moat for quick queries & exports (investor screenshots, benching, etc.)


5) Security/ops

IAM: Don’t keep using root keys. Create user/role sentientiq-ingest (S3 read/write specific prefixes) and sentientiq-ml (read model/artifacts only).

CORS: allow your Netlify domain on /pulse/* and /ask.

Secrets: keys in platform secrets (Fly/Railway), never in git. You already fixed Netlify envs—great.



6) Then, let's phase the rollout (fastest path first)

TODAY: Add the SSE endpoints + small in-memory pulse cache (even if the “pulse” is computed from a small sample). Wire the Faculty panel to show it.

Define EVI v0.1 (simple, explainable): e.g., z-scored volatility of the top-k emotion proportions over a rolling window (say 60 min) vs a trailing 24-hr baseline. Keep it a 0–100.

Batch a small window from sentientiq-processed-data:

If WE already store per-post emotion scores, and we may, aggregate with Athena:

group by minute → sum counts per emotion → compute proportions → EVI.

If we don’t, run a one-off inference pass to produce per-post emotion vectors, then aggregate.

Cache + SSE:

Write the latest {evi, emotions, sample, ts} to Redis (or in-process if single instance).

Expose /pulse/snapshot + /pulse/stream.

Wire the widget under “Consensus Level” (small chart + % + sparkline).
=> We've got a live market pulse with real data—today.




48–72h: Point ingester at your social sources → land in raw → processed, compute EVI in the worker, store to moat and cache for SSE.

Next: Persist consensus logs from /ask runs (the Faculty’s “why”) into moat/consensus/; show a tiny “Why EVI moved” hover in the UI using the latest factors.

That gets you the flash/pulse indicator investors love while you’re quietly filling the lake behind it.
