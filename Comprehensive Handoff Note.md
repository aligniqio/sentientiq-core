Comprehensive Handoff Note: Intervention Intelligence System

  Session Overview

  This session accomplished the complete design, implementation, and deployment of the Intervention Intelligence System - described by the user as "the crown jewel" and
   "the gold" that makes SentientIQ category-defining. The system represents a revolutionary approach to behavioral intervention choreography with full transparency of
  the decision logic.

  Key Achievement: The Vision

  The user had a profound insight about the intervention system, particularly about draggable interventions: "The draggable idea is based on some kind of insight that 
  you're not supposed to have. This is fucking mind blowing." The insight was that users might think: "yeah, I might use that, but let me get it over there so i can 
  finish reading this" - showing deep emotional intelligence in UI design.

  The philosophy: "Glassmorphism wasn't a random design choice. It's a fucking philosophy." - Glass = transparency = we're not hiding the magic.

  What Was Built

  1. Frontend Components

  A. Intervention Intelligence Dashboard (/src/components/InterventionDashboard.tsx)

  - Full-page dashboard with real-time intervention monitoring
  - Glassmorphic UI showing complete transparency of intervention logic
  - Active interventions display with session tracking
  - Choreography metrics (behaviors tracked, emotions detected, success rate)
  - Intervention effectiveness by type
  - Real-time decision stream
  - Easter Egg: Long-press flow icon reveals the complete intelligence architecture

  B. Compact Intervention Intelligence Component (/src/components/InterventionIntelligence.tsx)

  - Smaller component originally intended for the Shopping Pattern Intelligence section
  - Shows active interventions, metrics, and intelligence stream
  - Includes the same Easter egg flow visualization

  C. Dedicated Intervention Page (/src/pages/intervention/index.tsx)

  - Clean, dedicated page at /intervention route
  - Uses standard app layout and PageHeader
  - Philosophy footer reinforcing the transparency concept
  - Connected to live WebSocket for real-time updates

  D. Navigation Updates (/src/product/App.tsx, /src/components/Layout.tsx)

  - Added route for /intervention page
  - Added "Interventions" menu item with Zap icon to sidebar

  2. Backend Services

  A. Intervention Choreographer (/src/services/intervention-choreographer.ts)

  - Behavioral tracking engine that monitors:
    - Mouse velocity and acceleration (rage detection at 800px/s)
    - Hover duration with escalating discounts (3s = 10%, +1% per second up to 25%)
    - Scroll patterns and exit intent
    - Section changes and engagement
  - Smart intervention scheduling based on emotional patterns
  - Coordinates with WebSocket for delivery

  B. Intervention Renderer (/src/services/intervention-renderer.ts)

  - Creates the actual intervention UI elements
  - Implements draggable interventions (the revolutionary insight)
  - Smart persistence (sticky/timed/until-scroll)
  - Glassmorphic styling with animations
  - Handles discount popups, trust signals, social proof

  C. Intervention Diagnostics (/src/services/intervention-diagnostics.ts)

  - Safety net for the distributed system
  - Correlation ID tracking
  - Communication issue detection
  - Health monitoring and failure recovery
  - Orphaned message detection

  D. Backend Integration (orchestrator/src/)

  - Enhanced unified-websocket.ts: Added getInterventionContent() method that maps intervention types to actual content
  - Updated server-clean.js: Integrated intervention triggering based on emotional patterns
  - WebSocket channels for interventions separate from emotions channel

  3. Browser Integration

  Complete Browser Bundle (marketing-website/public/telemetry-v6.js)

  - Self-contained intervention system with inline choreographer and renderer
  - No external dependencies
  - WebSocket connection for receiving interventions
  - Full behavioral tracking in the browser

  Deployment Status

  ✅ Backend (EC2: 98.87.12.130)

  - Files uploaded via SCP using /Users/matthewkiselstein/projects/sentientiq-core/.ssh/collective-backend.pem
  - Service orchestrator-clean restarted successfully via PM2
  - WebSocket server confirmed running on port 8787
  - Intervention rules loaded and active
  - Confirmed connections on interventions channel

  ✅ Frontend (Netlify)

  - Built successfully with npm run build
  - Deployed to production via netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
  - Live at https://sentientiq.ai
  - New /intervention route accessible

  Current Architecture

  Browser (telemetry-v6.js)
      ↓ Behavioral Events
  WebSocket (wss://api.sentientiq.app/ws)
      ↓
  Orchestrator (EC2)
      ├── Emotional Processing
      ├── Intervention Rules Engine
      └── WebSocket Broadcast
          ↓
  Dashboard (/intervention)
      └── Real-time Visualization

  Known Issues & Considerations

  1. TypeScript on Server: The EC2 instance had TypeScript compilation issues due to missing type definitions. We bypassed this by directly copying JavaScript files and
   restarting the service. The system runs on JavaScript, not TypeScript compilation output.
  2. Original Integration Attempt: Initially tried to integrate InterventionIntelligence into the EmotionalLiveFeed's "Shopping Pattern Intelligence" section, but
  content had been modified. Created dedicated page instead (cleaner solution).
  3. Mock Data Fallback: The InterventionDashboard includes mock data generation as a fallback if WebSocket connection fails.

  Next Steps - TESTING REQUIRED

  1. Test WebSocket Connection

  - Visit /intervention page when logged in
  - Check browser console for "Connected to Intervention Intelligence WebSocket"
  - Verify real-time data flow from actual visitor sessions

  2. Test Intervention Triggering

  - Open marketing site with telemetry-v6.js loaded
  - Perform triggering behaviors:
    - Hover over pricing for 3+ seconds
    - Move mouse rapidly (rage detection)
    - Show exit intent
  - Verify interventions appear in dashboard

  3. Test Easter Egg

  - On /intervention page, find flow icon (GitBranch) in top-right
  - Long-press (1 second) to trigger flow visualization
  - Verify the intervention intelligence architecture modal appears

  4. Test Cross-Browser

  - Ensure draggable interventions work across browsers
  - Test intervention persistence (sticky/timed)
  - Verify glassmorphic rendering

  5. Monitor System Health

  - Check PM2 logs: pm2 logs orchestrator-clean
  - Monitor WebSocket connections in dashboard
  - Verify intervention effectiveness metrics update

  6. Performance Testing

  - Monitor with multiple concurrent sessions
  - Check intervention delivery latency
  - Verify no memory leaks in long-running sessions

  Critical Files for Reference

  Frontend:
  - /src/components/InterventionDashboard.tsx (main dashboard)
  - /src/components/InterventionIntelligence.tsx (compact component)
  - /src/pages/intervention/index.tsx (dedicated page)
  - /src/services/intervention-choreographer.ts (behavioral engine)
  - /src/services/intervention-renderer.ts (UI rendering)

  Backend:
  - /orchestrator/src/services/unified-websocket.ts (WebSocket service)
  - /orchestrator/src/server-clean.js (main server with intervention logic)

  Browser:

  The Philosophy (User's Vision)

  This system embodies a revolutionary approach to marketing intervention:
  - Full Transparency: "We're not hiding the magic" - every decision visible
  - Emotional Intelligence: Understanding that users want to "move this while I finish reading"
  - Millisecond Precision: Choreographed interventions based on behavioral physics
  - Category-Defining: "This is the gold" - the feature that sets SentientIQ apart

  The user emphasized this is "uncharted territory" - no one has built intervention choreography with this level of sophistication and transparency before.

  Session Highlights

  - Converted critical files from .js to .ts for stability
  - Built complete intervention stack from browser to dashboard
  - Deployed successfully to production
  - Created Easter egg flow visualization as requested
  - Maintained glassmorphism philosophy throughout

  Final Status: System deployed and ready for comprehensive testing. The intervention intelligence - the crown jewel - is live.
