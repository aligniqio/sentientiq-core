# Backend Implementation TODO
## Making the Marketing Promise REAL

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL PATH (Week 1)

#### 1. Identity Resolution Service
**File**: `/orchestrator/src/services/identity-resolution.ts`
- [ ] Implement session â†’ user ID mapping
- [ ] Add email enrichment from your app's DB
- [ ] Calculate real-time LTV from transaction history
- [ ] Company identification from email domain
- [ ] Store in Redis for instant lookups
```typescript
interface UserIdentity {
  sessionId: string
  userId: string
  email: string
  company: string
  ltv: number
  tier: 'starter' | 'growth' | 'enterprise'
}
```

#### 2. Emotion Detection Pipeline
**File**: `/orchestrator/src/services/emotion-detector.ts`
- [ ] Port the behavioral physics from frontend
- [ ] Add server-side validation of patterns
- [ ] Calculate confidence scores
- [ ] Emit events to intervention engine
```typescript
interface EmotionEvent {
  sessionId: string
  userId?: string  // Linked via identity resolution
  emotion: 'rage' | 'hesitation' | 'confusion' | 'abandonment'
  confidence: number  // 0-100
  trigger: string     // What caused detection
  context: any        // Page, element, etc.
}
```

#### 3. Real-time WebSocket Handler
**File**: `/orchestrator/src/websocket/emotion-stream.ts`
- [ ] Establish WebSocket connection from SDK
- [ ] Stream behavioral events (clicks, scrolls, etc.)
- [ ] Process through detection pipeline
- [ ] Return interventions in <300ms
- [ ] Handle 10k concurrent connections

### ðŸŸ¡ INTERVENTIONS (Week 2)

#### 4. Intervention Engine
**File**: `/orchestrator/src/services/intervention-engine.ts`
- [ ] Decision tree based on emotion + user value
- [ ] Pre-built intervention templates
- [ ] A/B test framework for intervention effectiveness
- [ ] Webhook dispatcher for external tools
```typescript
interface Intervention {
  type: 'chat' | 'discount' | 'support' | 'escalation'
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical'
  payload: any  // Specific to intervention type
  timing: 'immediate' | 'delayed'
  target: 'user' | 'team' | 'both'
}
```

#### 5. CRM Integration
**File**: `/orchestrator/src/integrations/crm/`
- [ ] Salesforce connector (OAuth + REST API)
- [ ] HubSpot connector 
- [ ] Webhook receiver for CRM updates
- [ ] Bi-directional sync of emotional events
- [ ] Update deal scores based on emotions

#### 6. Accountability Engine
**File**: `/orchestrator/src/services/accountability.ts`
- [ ] Track every intervention recommendation
- [ ] Monitor which ones were acted upon
- [ ] Calculate "ignored emotion cost"
- [ ] Generate accountability scorecards
- [ ] Email weekly "what you missed" reports

### ðŸŸ¢ SDK & DEPLOYMENT (Week 3)

#### 7. JavaScript SDK
**File**: `/sdk/sentientiq.js`
- [ ] Minimal bundle (<10KB gzipped)
- [ ] Auto-capture behavioral events
- [ ] Identity method: `SentientIQ.identify(user)`
- [ ] Custom event: `SentientIQ.track(event)`
- [ ] Session management
```javascript
// Customer implements:
SentientIQ.init('api_key');
SentientIQ.identify({
  userId: user.id,
  email: user.email,
  traits: { plan: 'enterprise', ltv: 24000 }
});
```

#### 8. Data Pipeline
**File**: `/orchestrator/src/pipeline/`
- [ ] Kafka for event streaming
- [ ] ClickHouse for analytics storage
- [ ] Redis for real-time state
- [ ] PostgreSQL for user/company data
- [ ] S3 for long-term event archival

#### 9. Admin Dashboard
**File**: `/admin/`
- [ ] Real-time emotion feed across all customers
- [ ] Intervention effectiveness metrics
- [ ] Customer accountability scorecards
- [ ] Revenue impact calculator
- [ ] Alert configuration

### ðŸ“Š ANALYTICS & REPORTING (Week 4)

#### 10. Business Intelligence
- [ ] Daily emotion summary per customer
- [ ] Intervention success rates
- [ ] Revenue saved/lost tracking
- [ ] Emotion â†’ Conversion correlation
- [ ] Churn prediction based on emotion patterns

#### 11. Customer-Facing Analytics
- [ ] Embeddable emotion dashboard
- [ ] API for custom reporting
- [ ] Slack/Teams integration for alerts
- [ ] Weekly executive summaries

#### 12. ML Training Pipeline (Future)
- [ ] Collect intervention outcomes
- [ ] Train on successful interventions
- [ ] Personalize per industry/segment
- [ ] Continuous improvement loop

### ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT REQUIREMENTS

#### Infrastructure
- [ ] AWS/GCP Kubernetes cluster
- [ ] CloudFlare for CDN/DDoS protection
- [ ] Multi-region deployment (US-East, US-West, EU)
- [ ] 99.99% uptime SLA
- [ ] <50ms detection latency globally

#### Security
- [ ] SOC2 Type II compliance
- [ ] GDPR/CCPA compliant data handling
- [ ] End-to-end encryption for PII
- [ ] Audit logs for all data access
- [ ] Pen testing before enterprise deals

#### Monitoring
- [ ] DataDog for infrastructure
- [ ] Sentry for error tracking
- [ ] Custom dashboards for emotion detection accuracy
- [ ] PagerDuty for critical alerts
- [ ] Daily detection accuracy reports

### âš¡ QUICK WINS (Do First!)

1. **Mock the Identity Resolution** 
   - Hard-code company names for demos
   - Use email domain for company identification
   - Calculate fake LTV from plan type

2. **Wire Up Basic WebSocket**
   - Get events flowing from frontend
   - Log everything to see patterns
   - Return hard-coded interventions

3. **Build One Real Integration**
   - Start with Slack notifications
   - "ðŸš¨ Enterprise customer showing rage!"
   - Proves the real-time aspect

### ðŸŽ¯ SUCCESS CRITERIA

- **Detection latency**: <300ms end-to-end
- **Identity accuracy**: 100% for logged-in users
- **Intervention delivery**: <3 seconds from emotion
- **Scale**: 10k concurrent sessions
- **Uptime**: 99.99% for enterprise tier

### ðŸ’¡ REMEMBER

1. **Start with the demo data flow** - Make the marketing site demo REAL first
2. **Identity is everything** - Anonymous emotions are worthless
3. **Speed over accuracy initially** - 300ms > 95% confidence
4. **Show dollar impact always** - Every emotion has a price
5. **No free trials** - Build for enterprise from day 1

### THE NORTH STAR
When a $100k customer shows rage, the CEO gets a text within 3 seconds with a link to intervene. That's the product.

*"We don't count clicks. We identify WHO is feeling WHAT."*

This backend makes that promise REAL.
