# Backend Implementation - REAL EMOTIONAL FORENSICS
## Not ABM Theater. Not Intent Data Bullshit. Actual Behavioral Physics.

### üéØ THE NORTH STAR
When a $100k customer shows rage, the CEO gets a text within 3 seconds with a link to intervene. That's the product.

### WHO WE ARE
**Emotional Intelligence Marketing** - We don't track clicks, we map emotional intent. Instead of "they clicked 47 times" we know "they're experiencing decision anxiety at 91% confidence." Marketing has always measured the shadows. SentientIQ measures the substance.

### WHAT WE'RE REPLACING
The entire ABM/Intent Data industry that runs on `GenerateBullshitInsights()` and Math.random(). No theater. Just fact. Failures are public. They're honest.

  dashboardUrl: string // One-click intervention link
}
```

### 5. Executive Escalation System

## üìä DATA ARCHITECTURE - AWS NATIVE (Week 3)

### 7. Event Stream Processing
**File**: `/orchestrator/src/pipeline/stream-processor.ts`
- [ ] NATS JetStream for all events (replaces Kafka/Redis)
- [ ] S3 + Parquet for event storage
- [ ] Athena for SQL queries on S3 data
- [ ] Glue for ETL when needed
- [ ] DynamoDB for user state (if needed)
```javascript
// Data flow: Browser ‚Üí WebSocket ‚Üí NATS ‚Üí S3 ‚Üí Athena
// Hot path: Browser ‚Üí WebSocket ‚Üí NATS ‚Üí Intervention (sub-300ms)
// Analytics: S3 ‚Üí Glue ‚Üí Athena ‚Üí QuickSight
```

- [ ] S3 data lake with lifecycle policies
- [ ] Athena queries for emotion patterns
- [ ] QuickSight dashboards for customers
- [ ] Daily emotion weather reports

### 9. SDK - The Trojan Horse
**File**: `/sdk/sentientiq.js`
- [ ] 8KB gzipped maximum
- [ ] WebWorker for off-thread processing
- [ ] Binary protocol for efficiency
- [ ] Automatic identity enrichment
- [ ] Zero-config installation
```javascript
// One line to $100k saved:
SentientIQ.init('api_key');
// Auto-identifies from your app's auth
// Auto-enriches from your CRM
// Auto-intervenes based on value
```

## üíÄ WHAT WE DON'T DO

### No Bullshit List
- ‚ùå NO mock data or fake demos
- ‚ùå NO Math.random() anywhere near insights
- ‚ùå NO "ML/AI" claims without proof
- ‚ùå NO anonymous intervention attempts
- ‚ùå NO delays on high-value accounts
- ‚ùå NO hiding failures or false positives
- ‚ùå NO quick wins or shortcuts

---

## üìà SUCCESS METRICS

### Hard Numbers Only
- **Detection latency**: <300ms (measured at 95th percentile)
- **CEO alert time**: <3 seconds from rage detection
- **Identity accuracy**: 100% for logged-in users
- **False positive rate**: <0.1% for interventions
- **Intervention success**: >40% prevent churn
- **Revenue attribution**: Every saved dollar tracked
- **Scale**: 10k concurrent sessions per region
- **Cost**: <$0.001 per emotion detected

---

## üé¨ THE VISION

**Week 1**: A $100k customer rages. CEO gets text. Customer saved.
**Week 4**: 1000 interventions/day. $10M in prevented churn tracked.
**Quarter 2**: Replace every ABM tool. "Why guess when you can know?"
**Year 1**: EVI becomes industry standard. "What's your emotional weather?"

---

## üî• THE DIFFERENCE

**Them**: "Our AI analyzed 50,000 intent signals..."
**Us**: "Your customer John is having a breakdown on pricing. Here's his phone number."

**Them**: "This quarter's lead score improved by 12%..."
**Us**: "We prevented $2.4M in churn this morning. Here are the receipts."

**Them**: `if (Math.random() > 0.7) { show_intent_signal() }`
**Us**: Actual physics. Actual emotions. Actual money saved.

*"We don't count clicks. We identify WHO is feeling WHAT, and we do it faster than your page loads."*

This isn't analytics. This is **emotional forensics as a service**.

The backend that makes intervention instant, attribution exact, and failures visible.
