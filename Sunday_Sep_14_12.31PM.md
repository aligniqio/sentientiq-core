SentientIQ Complete Status Update

  🚀 What We Accomplished Yesterday

  1. GTM Template Distribution System

  - ✅ Created and configured GTM template (sentientiq.tpl)
  - ✅ Hosted at https://cdn.sentientiq.ai/sentientiq.tpl
  - ✅ Set up proper netlify redirects with download headers
  - ✅ Updated implementation page with download button and import instructions
  - ✅ Cleaned up detect scripts - only detect-v2.js remains (was v4, renamed for GTM compatibility)
  - ✅ Test API key: sq_demo_user_2zZ59bWotlSk5kLkrLKRtMMxDAn

  2. Sage API & Personality Transformation

  - ✅ Fixed nginx routing issue (/api/sage/ → port 8004)
  - ✅ Response time improved from 9-10s to ~6.9s
  - ✅ Transformed Sage from generic to theatrical film noir personality
  - ✅ Added context awareness (helpful on implementation pages, cynical on spam)
  - ✅ Title: "Support Specialist & Resident Cynic"

  3. UI Improvements

  - ✅ Expanded SageCrystalBall width from 396px to 550px (50% wider)
  - ✅ Added TypewriterText component with paragraph separation
  - ✅ Speed set to 25ms/char for readability

  4. Tenant System Architecture

  - ✅ Created comprehensive Supabase schema:
    - organizations table (integrates with Clerk orgs)
    - organization_members table
    - api_keys table
    - subscription_tiers table
    - Row Level Security policies
  - ✅ Built useEnhancedSubscription hook mapping old tiers to new
  - ✅ Created usage dashboard with visual progress bars
  - ✅ Verified you're correctly marked as enterprise tier

  5. Sage Hint System

  - ✅ Fixed z-index issues
  - ✅ Made tenant-aware (only shows for users <7 days old or <5 interactions)
  - ✅ Added dismissible options (X button and permanent "Don't show again")

  🎯 Current System State

  Working & Deployed:

  - ✅ Sage API fully functional with new personality
  - ✅ Tenant system integrated with Clerk & Stripe
  - ✅ Usage tracking and limits enforcement
  - ✅ GTM template ready for distribution
  - ✅ Emotional detection script (detect-v2.js)
  - ✅ Real-time emotional feed dashboard
  - ✅ Support for multiple API keys per organization

  Infrastructure:

  - Frontend: React app at app.sentientiq.ai
  - Marketing: Static site at sentientiq.ai/cdn.sentientiq.ai
  - API: EC2 at api.sentientiq.app (ports 8001-8004)
  - Database: Supabase (tenant data, usage tracking)
  - Auth: Clerk (organizations & users)
  - Billing: Stripe (subscriptions)

  🔮 Next Steps (What You Mentioned)

  1. Interventions System (Today's Focus)

  You mentioned: "Appreciate the kind words. There's just one rather complex piece to connect, the interventions..."

  This likely involves:
  - Connecting emotional detection to triggered actions
  - Creating intervention rules based on emotional states
  - Building the response system (popups, chat, redirects, etc.)
  - Dashboard for configuring interventions
  - A/B testing framework for interventions

  2. Potential Architecture for Interventions

  // Conceptual structure
  {
    trigger: {
      emotion: 'frustration',
      intensity: 0.8,
      duration: 3000,
      page: '/checkout'
    },
    intervention: {
      type: 'chat_prompt',
      message: 'Need help completing your order?',
      delay: 500
    },
    conditions: {
      user_segment: 'new_visitor',
      time_on_page: '>30s'
    }
  }

  🛠️ Recommended Immediate Actions

  1. Backup Current State (if not already done):
  git add -A
  git commit -m "GTM template distribution complete, pre-interventions"
  git push

  2. Test GTM Template Import:
  - Try importing template from CDN URL
  - Verify detect-v2.js loads correctly
  - Check emotional events are tracked

  3. Define Intervention Requirements:
  - What types of interventions? (chat, popup, redirect, etc.)
  - How should they be triggered?
  - Configuration interface needed?
  - Storage schema for intervention rules?

  💡 Questions for Interventions Design

  1. Should interventions be configured per API key or per organization?
  2. Do you want a visual rule builder or JSON/code configuration?
  3. Should interventions support custom JavaScript execution?
  4. A/B testing built-in or use external tool?
  5. Real-time preview/testing capability needed?

  🚨 Critical Paths

  All critical systems are operational:
  - Emotional detection ✅
  - API routing ✅
  - Tenant management ✅
  - Billing integration ✅
  - GTM distribution ✅
