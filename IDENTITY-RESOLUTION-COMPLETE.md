# SentientIQ Identity Resolution & Marketing Site - Complete

## What We Built

### ðŸŽ¯ Identity Resolution System
The core innovation that changes everything. We now know WHO is feeling WHAT.

**Backend Services:**
- `identity-resolution.ts` - Links emotions to users with email, company, and value
- `crm-integration.ts` - Real-time sync with Salesforce & HubSpot
- `webhook-dispatcher.ts` - Fires events anywhere with retry logic
- `intervention-engine.ts` - Decision tree for automated responses
- `accountability-engine.ts` - Tracks every recommendation and outcome
- `identity-intervention-api.ts` - REST endpoints for the entire system

**Client Integration:**
- Enhanced `detect.js` with `SentientIQ.identify()` method
- Sends user identity with every emotional event
- One line of code: `SentientIQ.identify({userId, email, value})`

### ðŸ“ˆ Marketing Website Transformation
From wandering focus to cohesive crescendo.

**New Narrative Structure:**
1. **Hero** - Your customers are screaming. You can't hear them.
2. **Identity Reveal** - WHO is feeling WHAT (centerpiece)
3. **Intervention Showcase** - Every emotion has a prescribed response
4. **Accountability Proof** - What ignoring emotions costs
5. **Transparency Manifesto** - Glassmorphism as a statement

**New Components:**
- `IdentityReveal.tsx` - Shows live examples of identified emotions
- `InterventionShowcase.tsx` - Demonstrates automated responses
- `AccountabilityProof.tsx` - Live dashboard of ignored recommendations
- `TransparencyManifesto.tsx` - The crystal palace of marketing truth

## The Complete Flow

1. **Detection**: Behavioral physics identifies emotion (300ms)
2. **Resolution**: Connect emotion to CRM identity
3. **Valuation**: Determine customer worth
4. **Intervention**: Trigger value-appropriate response
5. **Accountability**: Track if action was taken
6. **Attribution**: Measure revenue saved or lost

## Key Capabilities

### Identity Resolution
- Connect emotions to email, company, LTV
- Enrich profiles with tier and value
- Link anonymous sessions to known users
- Flag high-value users for priority

### Intervention Engine
- Pre-built rules for rage, confusion, abandonment
- Value-based response (Enterprise gets CEO alert)
- Multi-channel dispatch (Slack, email, CRM, webhook)
- Cooldowns and daily limits

### Accountability System
- Track every recommendation made
- Record outcomes (saved/lost)
- Calculate revenue impact
- Grade companies A-F on response rate
- Show exactly what inaction costs

### CRM Integration
- HubSpot: Timeline events + properties
- Salesforce: Custom objects + tasks
- Emotions appear in CRM before sales calls
- Automatic task creation for critical events

## The Glassmorphism Statement

The transparent design isn't aesthetic - it's philosophical:
- No black boxes
- No "trust our algorithm"
- No hidden pricing
- No mock data
- Everything visible, everything accountable

## What Makes This Different

**Before**: "User 123 clicked 47 times"
**Now**: "john@fortune500.com is raging at checkout, $100k ARR at risk"

**Before**: "High intent score"
**Now**: "Decision paralysis detected, simplify to single option"

**Before**: "23% bounce rate"
**Now**: "$342,000 lost from ignored rage interventions"

## Next Steps

The architecture is complete for Phase 2 (Identity Resolution) and Phase 3 (Interventions). The system is ready to:

1. Deploy the enhanced orchestrator with identity services
2. Update the production detect.js with identity capture
3. Configure CRM credentials for live sync
4. Set up webhook endpoints for customer integrations
5. Launch with the new focused marketing message

## The Bottom Line

Every emotion now has:
- A name
- A company
- A dollar value
- A prescribed intervention
- An accountability score

This isn't analytics anymore. It's forensic revenue protection powered by behavioral physics.
