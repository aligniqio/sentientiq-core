## Title
Unstuck - Developer's BS Detector

## Short Description (132 chars max)
When you're debugging at 2am and starting to suspect the entire "AI platform" is just Math.random(). For devs who've seen too much.

## Detailed Description

### 🔍 That Weird Feeling About Your Codebase? You're Right.

**Unstuck** is a forensic analysis tool for developers who suspect their company's expensive "AI-powered" platform might just be Math.random() with enterprise pricing.

### Who Needs This?

✓ Found `// TODO: Implement actual ML` in production?
✓ Been told "you wouldn't understand the algorithm"?
✓ Maintaining an "AI platform" that never seems to learn?
✓ Your company pays $60k/year for "intent data"?
✓ That weird feeling that it's all fake?

**You need Unstuck.**

### What It Does

🎲 **Detects Math.random()** in AI/ML contexts
🔄 **Replay Test** - Watch "historical" data change on refresh
📊 **Statistical Analysis** - Benford's Law, entropy checks
⚡ **Network Analysis** - Catches client-side data generation
📸 **Evidence Collection** - Screenshots for Slack/Twitter

### Real Developer Reviews

"Holy s***, our entire scoring engine is Math.random()" - Anonymous Jr. Dev

"Delete this immediately" - Anonymous Sr. Dev

"Is this why we've been debugging for 6 months?" - Anonymous Team Lead

"I knew it. I KNEW IT." - Every developer ever

### How It Works

1. Install Unstuck
2. Visit your "AI dashboard"
3. Click the icon
4. Watch the truth unfold
5. Share with your team (or dev Twitter)

### What You'll Discover

```javascript
// The "AI" you're maintaining:
function getMLScore() {
  return Math.random() * 100; // TODO: Add actual ML
}
```

### Features

✅ **Zero Config** - Just install and go
✅ **Privacy First** - All analysis happens locally
✅ **Developer Friendly** - Console logs for verification
✅ **Evidence Mode** - Timestamped proof for your team
✅ **Replay Testing** - The killer feature that proves it's fake

### Not Convinced?

Try this experiment:
1. Open your platform's dashboard
2. Note the "historical AI scores"
3. Refresh the page
4. Watch history rewrite itself
5. Install Unstuck to confirm your suspicions

### Legal & Ethical

This tool only analyzes client-side JavaScript already running in your browser. It doesn't hack, breach, or access private systems. If detecting Math.random() threatens your vendor's "AI," maybe ask why.

### For Developers, By Developers

Built by engineers who've maintained too many "AI platforms" that were just random number generators. It's time for truth in tech.

⚠️ **Warning**: May cause sudden clarity about your company's tech stack, uncomfortable conversations with vendors, and viral tweets.

💡 **Pro Tip**: Install Friday evening for maximum weekend virality.

🔥 **Remember**: That weird feeling about the codebase? You were right all along.
