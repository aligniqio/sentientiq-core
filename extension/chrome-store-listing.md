Enterprise-grade verification for marketing intelligence platforms. Detects fraudulent scoring algorithms in real-time.

## Detailed Description

### The Problem
CMOs spend millions on "AI-powered" intent data platforms. But what if those sophisticated algorithms are actually just Math.random()?

### The Solution
DataTruth Pro monitors marketing intelligence platforms in real-time, detecting when random number generators are disguised as machine learning algorithms.

### Key Features
✓ **Real-Time Detection** - Catches Math.random() calls as they happen
✓ **Platform Recognition** - Automatically identifies major intent data vendors
✓ **Replay Test** - Proves data is generated, not collected
✓ **Enterprise Ready** - Professional reporting for C-suite presentations
✓ **100% Transparent** - Only flags actual fraud, no false positives

### How It Works
1. Install DataTruth Pro
2. Navigate to any marketing intelligence platform
3. Watch for Math.random() detection in real-time
4. Run the Replay Test to verify data consistency
5. Get forensic evidence of fraudulent algorithms

### Who Should Use This
- CMOs evaluating intent data platforms
- Marketing Operations professionals
- Data analysts verifying vendor claims
- CFOs questioning marketing spend
