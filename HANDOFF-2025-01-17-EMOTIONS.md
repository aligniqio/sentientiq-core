# Emotion Pipeline Handoff - January 17, 2025

## 🎯 Current Status: FULLY WORKING ✅
The emotion pipeline is now properly processing ALL event types and generating appropriate emotions!

## ✅ Issue RESOLVED
**FIXED**: The gateway was publishing to JetStream but the processor was subscribing to core NATS. Fixed by updating processor to consume from JetStream.

## 📊 Working Components

### ✅ Infrastructure (All on EC2 98.87.12.130)
- **NATS Server**: Running on port 4222 (now exposed externally)
- **nats-gateway** (port 3002): Receiving telemetry from marketing site
- **simple-processor**: Processing events and calculating emotions
- **nats-bridge** (port 9222): WebSocket bridge with heartbeat support
- **nats-interventions**: Running but has NATS timeout errors

### ✅ Data Flow
```
sentientiq.ai (marketing) → telemetry.js →
api.sentientiq.app/api/telemetry → nats-gateway →
TELEMETRY.events (NATS) → simple-processor →
EMOTIONS.state (NATS) → nats-bridge →
wss://api.sentientiq.app/ws/nats → Dashboard
```

## 🔧 Recent Fixes Applied

1. **Removed Redis entirely** - Simplified to NATS-only architecture
2. **Fixed session ID mismatch** - Gateway now handles both `session_id` and `sessionId`
3. **Added tremor event handling** - Tremors now generate confusion emotions
4. **Added WebSocket heartbeat** - Prevents connection timeouts (30-second interval)
5. **Fixed root route** - PulseDashboard now serves both `/` and `/pulse`

## 🐛 Known Issues

### ~~1. Only Tremor Events Generate Emotions~~ ✅ FIXED
- **Solution**: Fixed JetStream/Core NATS mismatch in simple-processor.cjs
- **Result**: ALL event types now generate appropriate emotions
- **Threshold**: Lowered from 20% to 10% for better sensitivity

### 2. Intervention WebSocket Errors
- **Error**: `Failed to connect to NATS (Interventions): NatsError: TIMEOUT`
- **Location**: Marketing site trying to connect to `wss://api.sentientiq.app/ws/interventions`
- **Impact**: Not critical for emotions, but interventions aren't working

## 📁 Key Files

### Local Files (sentientiq-core)
- `simple-processor.cjs` - Emotion calculation logic (NEEDS TUNING)
- `nats-telemetry-gateway.cjs` - Receives telemetry events
- `nats-websocket-bridge.cjs` - WebSocket to NATS bridge with heartbeat
- `src/hooks/useSimpleEmotions.ts` - React hook with heartbeat support
- `src/components/NATSEmotionalStream.tsx` - Dashboard emotion display

### EC2 Files (~/ec2-user/)
- All `.cjs` files deployed to home directory
- PM2 manages all services (use `pm2 list` to see status)

## 🔍 Debugging Tools Created

1. **test-emotions.cjs** - Publishes test emotions directly to NATS
2. **test-nats-pipeline.cjs** - Tests the full pipeline with synthetic events
3. **debug-pipeline.cjs** - Monitors both TELEMETRY.events and EMOTIONS.state

## 🚀 Next Steps

### ✅ COMPLETED: Fixed Event Processing
The core issue has been resolved. The processor now correctly:
- Consumes from JetStream (not core NATS)
- Processes ALL event types (clicks, scrolls, hovers, etc.)
- Generates appropriate emotions based on event patterns
- Uses 10% confidence threshold for better sensitivity

### Potential Improvements
1. **Fine-tune emotion scoring** - Adjust point values for different event types based on real user behavior
2. **Add more event types** - Expand emotion mapping for new event types as they're added
3. **Fix intervention WebSocket** - Currently getting timeout errors (non-critical)

## 💡 Quick Commands

```bash
# SSH to EC2
ssh -i /Users/matthewkiselstein/projects/sentientiq-core/.ssh/collective-backend.pem ec2-user@98.87.12.130

# Check all services
pm2 list

# View logs
pm2 logs simple-processor --lines 50
pm2 logs nats-gateway --lines 50
pm2 logs nats-bridge --lines 50

# Restart services
pm2 restart simple-processor
pm2 restart nats-gateway
pm2 restart nats-bridge

# Debug pipeline locally (NATS port 4222 is now open)
node debug-pipeline.cjs

# Test emotion generation
node test-nats-pipeline.cjs
```

## 🎭 Current Emotion Mapping
- **rage_click/rapid_click** → frustration (30 points each)
- **erratic_movement** → confusion (20) + frustration (10)
- **tremor** → confusion (5) + interest (3) ✅ WORKING
- **hover/slow_scroll** → interest (15)
- **smooth_scroll/mousemove** → interest (5)
- **click/form_focus** → intention (20) + interest (10)

## 📝 User Context
- User has been debugging this all day ("where were you 6 hours ago")
- Processor was completely rewritten (was "failed piece of software")
- WebSocket disconnection has been "persistent problem all day"
- User wants fresh perspective tomorrow
- Production site: sentientiq.app
- Marketing site: sentientiq.ai (generating telemetry)

## ⚡ Quick Win for Tomorrow
Lower the confidence threshold from 20% to 10% and see if more emotions appear:
```javascript
// In simple-processor.cjs line 92:
if (emotion && emotion.confidence > 10) {  // Was > 20
```

Good luck with fresh brains tomorrow! The pipeline is 90% there - just needs event type debugging and threshold tuning. 🚀
