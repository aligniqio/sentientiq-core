# SentientIQ Pattern Learning System - Handoff Notes
## January 15, 2025

## üéØ Current Status: Pattern Learning Layer Deployed

### What We Built Today

#### 1. **Pattern Learning Database Layer**
- Created comprehensive SQL schema for tenant-aware pattern storage
- Tables: `emotional_patterns`, `session_outcomes`, `intervention_effectiveness`, `volatility_metrics`, `pattern_insights`
- Patterns learn from outcomes: conversion vs abandonment
- Each tenant sees only their data - "Your shoppers typically experience X when doing Y"

#### 2. **Behavior Processor Enhancements**
- Fixed price emotion false positives - now only triggers when hovering/oscillating on pricing
- Added demo interaction emotions: `curiosity ‚Üí intrigue ‚Üí demo_activation` (98% confidence)
- Normal scrolling triggers appropriate emotions: `moderate_curiosity`, `delight`, `deep_reading`
- Full persistence layer with `learnFromSession()`, `persistPattern()`, `getTenantInsights()`

#### 3. **Dashboard Redesign**
- EVI display at 80% width with Active Users card beside it
- Removed 4 unnecessary metric cards
- Added **Shopping Pattern Intelligence** section showing:
  - AI-analyzed insights with impact scores
  - Actionable recommendations
  - Pattern statistics (conversion/abandonment paths)
- Auto-refreshes insights every 30 seconds

#### 4. **API Endpoints**
- `/api/telemetry/stream` - Receives behaviors, diagnoses emotions
- `/api/emotional/tenant-insights/:tenantId` - Returns pattern insights for dashboard
- `/api/emotional/evi` - Emotional Volatility Index calculation
- `/api/emotional/market-insights` - Bloomberg Terminal data

## üìä Architecture Overview

```
Frontend (telemetry-v5.js)
    ‚Üì [Raw Behaviors]
Orchestrator (behavior-processor.js)
    ‚Üì [Diagnoses Emotions]
    ‚Üì [Learns Patterns]
Database (Supabase)
    ‚Üì [Stores Patterns]
Dashboard (Shopping Intelligence)
    ‚Üì [Shows Insights]
User Gets Recommendations
```

## üîÑ Current Data Flow

1. **Collection**: `telemetry-v5.js` records raw behaviors (clicks, scrolls, hovers)
2. **Diagnosis**: `behavior-processor.js` converts behaviors ‚Üí emotions
3. **Learning**: System records emotion paths that lead to outcomes
4. **Persistence**: Patterns stored in Supabase with confidence scores
5. **Intelligence**: Dashboard shows "Your shoppers experience sticker shock at premium tiers"
6. **Action**: Recommendations like "Show value before revealing pricing"

## üöÄ Next Steps: Intervention Engine

### Immediate Priority: Close the Loop
The pattern detection is working, but we need to **trigger interventions in real-time**:

1. **Assess Current Intervention Engine**
   - File: `/orchestrator/src/services/intervention-engine.ts` (35KB)
   - Already has pattern ‚Üí intervention mapping
   - WebSocket delivery via `unified-websocket.js`
   - Client receiver: `intervention-receiver.js`

2. **Implementation Tasks**
   ```javascript
   // In behavior-processor.js processBatch():
   if (pattern.type === 'abandonment_risk' && pattern.confidence > 80) {
     // Trigger intervention NOW
     unifiedWS.sendIntervention(sessionId, 'exit_intent_modal');
   }
   ```

3. **Intervention Types to Implement**
   - **Exit Intent Modal**: When mouse exits after pricing
   - **Cart Save Reminder**: When hesitation in checkout
   - **Trust Badges**: When detecting trust_hesitation
   - **Progressive Discount**: When price_paralysis detected
   - **Demo Trigger**: When curiosity but no demo_activation

4. **Testing Flow**
   - Visit site with telemetry-v5.js active
   - Trigger pattern (e.g., hover on price ‚Üí mouse exit)
   - Verify intervention displays
   - Track effectiveness in `intervention_effectiveness` table

### Key Files for Intervention Work

```bash
# Backend - Intervention Logic
/orchestrator/src/services/intervention-engine.ts  # Main intervention engine
/orchestrator/src/services/unified-websocket.js   # WebSocket delivery
/orchestrator/src/server-clean.js                  # API endpoints

# Frontend - Intervention Display
/marketing-website/public/intervention-receiver.js # Displays interventions
/marketing-website/public/telemetry-v5.js         # Sends behaviors

# Dashboard - Monitoring
/src/components/EmotionalLiveFeed.tsx             # Shows patterns & insights
```

### Pattern ‚Üí Intervention Mapping

| Pattern Detected | Intervention | Timing |
|-----------------|--------------|--------|
| `sticker_shock ‚Üí mouse_exit` | Exit modal with discount | Immediate |
| `cart_hesitation > 3s` | Cart save reminder | After 3 seconds |
| `price_paralysis > 5s` | Payment plan offer | After 5 seconds |
| `demo_interest ‚Üí no_click` | Floating demo button | After 2 seconds |
| `trust_hesitation` | Security badges | Immediate |
| `comparison_shopping` | Comparison chart | On tab return |

### Success Metrics to Track

1. **Intervention Trigger Rate**: How often patterns trigger interventions
2. **Click-through Rate**: Users clicking intervention CTAs
3. **Conversion Lift**: Conversion rate with vs without interventions
4. **Pattern Accuracy**: Do predicted outcomes match actual outcomes?

## üß† Pattern Learning Insights

The system is now learning that:
- Demo engagement strongly correlates with conversion (90% confidence)
- Sticker shock on premium tiers leads to abandonment (85% confidence)
- Multiple hesitation points indicate trust issues (75% confidence)

These insights appear in the dashboard with recommendations like:
- "Make your demo more prominent"
- "Show value propositions before pricing"
- "Add social proof at decision points"

## üî• Quick Start for Next Session

```bash
# Check orchestrator logs
ssh -i .ssh/collective-backend.pem ec2-user@api.sentientiq.app
pm2 logs orchestrator-clean

# Test pattern detection
curl https://api.sentientiq.app/api/emotional/tenant-insights/YOUR_TENANT_ID

# Monitor WebSocket
wscat -c wss://api.sentientiq.app/ws?channel=interventions
```

## üí° Key Insights from Today

1. **Separation of Concerns Works**: Frontend collects, backend diagnoses
2. **Session Age Matters**: First 5 seconds = exploring, not buying
3. **Context is Everything**: Scrolling near pricing ‚â† price evaluation
4. **Patterns Emerge Quickly**: After just a few sessions, clear paths appear
5. **Tenant Isolation Critical**: Each business has unique patterns

## üéØ Vision Reminder

We're building the **"Bloomberg Terminal for Emotions"** - the emotional nervous system of the internet. Every website will understand not just what users do, but what they FEEL. This isn't about conversion optimization - it's about making the web emotionally intelligent.

The pattern learning layer is the foundation. The intervention engine is the action layer. Together, they create a system that learns, predicts, and acts on human emotion in real-time.

**Current Deploy Status**:
- ‚úÖ Database migrations applied
- ‚úÖ Orchestrator running on EC2 (`orchestrator-clean`)
- ‚úÖ Frontend live at https://sentientiq.ai
- ‚úÖ Pattern learning active and persisting
- ‚è≥ Intervention engine assessment needed
- ‚è≥ Real-time intervention triggering to implement

**Next Session Goal**: Get interventions firing based on learned patterns. When the system detects `sticker_shock ‚Üí mouse_exit`, it should immediately show an exit modal with a discount. Close the loop from detection ‚Üí action.
