## What Happens After You Buy

### Step 1: You Get an Email (2 minutes after purchase)
```
Subject: Your SentientIQ is Ready - Let's Save Your First Customer

Hi Sarah,

Your SentientIQ account is active. Here's what happens next:

1. Click this button: [ACTIVATE SENTIENTIQ]
2. Add ONE line to your website (I'll show you how)
3. Watch your first emotion appear (usually within 30 seconds)

Your dedicated setup specialist: Mike Chen
Direct line: (415) 555-0100
Calendly: https://calendly.com/mike-sentientiq/setup

Let's do this together. Right now if you want.

-The SentientIQ Team
```

### Step 2: The Setup Call (15 minutes)

Mike from our team shares your screen and:

1. **Opens your website's admin panel** (WordPress, Shopify, whatever you use)
2. **Pastes one line of code** in the right spot
3. **Shows you the emotions appearing** in real-time
4. **Tests it with you** - "Move your mouse fast... see that? That's rage detection."
5. **Connects your phone** for CEO alerts

You don't type anything. Mike does it all.

## "But I Have a Custom Website"

No problem. Mike will:

1. **Email your web team** this exact message:
```
Subject: 5-Minute Change Request - CEO Priority

Hi Web Team,

Please add this one line before </head> on all pages:

<script src="https://cdn.sentientiq.app/sdk.js" data-api-key="YOUR_KEY_HERE"></script>

That's it. No other changes needed.

This is for our new customer intelligence platform.

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

2. **Follow up** to ensure it's done
3. **Verify it's working** with you

## Common Questions

### "What if I use Salesforce/HubSpot/Pipedrive?"
We connect to all of them. Mike does it on the setup call. You just log in once.

### "How do I know it's working?"
Open your website in another tab. Move your mouse really fast. Your phone will buzz within 3 seconds.

### "Can my team get alerts too?"
Yes. Add unlimited team members. Each picks their alert threshold:
- CEO: $100k+ customers only
- Sales VP: $50k+ customers
- Account Managers: Their accounts only

### "What about our privacy policy?"
We provide approved language. Your legal team usually approves in 1 day:
```
"We use behavioral analytics to improve your experience and provide faster support when needed."
```

### "Do I need to train my team?"
No. When alerts come, they have three buttons:
1. Call Now (opens their phone dialer)
2. Send Discount (one click, done)
3. Open Chat (joins the conversation)

### Common "Issues" (Non-Issues)

2. **"My phone didn't buzz"**
   - Check: Is the customer worth $100k+? (We don't wake you for small accounts)

3. **"The dashboard is empty"**
   - Your website might cache JavaScript. We'll clear it. Takes 2 minutes.

## Remember

**You don't need to understand how it works.**

You didn't understand how email worked in 1995.
You didn't understand how Google Ads worked in 2001.
You didn't understand how Salesforce worked in 2005.

You just used them. And they worked.

SentientIQ is the same. One line of code. Then it just works.

When your biggest customer is about to leave, your phone buzzes.
You click one button.
They stay.

**That's it. That's the product.**

*P.S. - If you're reading this and thinking "this sounds too simple" - that's the point. Complex problems don't require complex solutions. They require the RIGHT solution. This is it.*
