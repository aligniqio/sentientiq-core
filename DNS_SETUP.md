# DNS Configuration for sentientiq.ai

## Netlify DNS Settings

Add these records at your domain registrar (GoDaddy/Namecheap/etc):

### For apex domain (sentientiq.ai):
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 75.2.60.5
TTL: 1 hour
```

### For www subdomain:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: sentientiq-core-collective.netlify.app
TTL: 1 hour
```

### Alternative (if your registrar supports ALIAS/ANAME):
```
Type: ALIAS (or ANAME)
Name: @
Value: sentientiq-core-collective.netlify.app
TTL: 1 hour
```

## Steps to Configure:

1. **In Netlify:**
   - Go to: https://app.netlify.com/sites/sentientiq-core-collective/settings/domain
   - Click "Add custom domain"
   - Add: sentientiq.ai
   - Add: www.sentientiq.ai

2. **At Your Domain Registrar:**
   - Login to GoDaddy/Namecheap/your registrar
   - Go to DNS settings for sentientiq.ai
   - Delete any existing A or CNAME records for @ and www
   - Add the records above

3. **SSL Certificate:**
   - Netlify will automatically provision SSL after DNS propagates
   - This can take 10-30 minutes

4. **Verify:**
   - Check DNS propagation: https://dnschecker.org/#A/sentientiq.ai
   - Wait for SSL to provision in Netlify

## Current Status:
- Frontend deployed to: sentientiq-core-collective.netlify.app
- Custom domain needed: sentientiq.ai
- SSL: Will auto-provision after DNS setup

## Troubleshooting:
- If SSL doesn't provision after 30 mins, click "Verify DNS configuration" in Netlify
- DNS propagation can take up to 48 hours (usually much faster)
- Clear browser cache if you see old content
