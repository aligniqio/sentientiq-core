# STATE OF THINGS - SentientIQ Core
**Last Updated:** September 4, 2025, ~8:30am PT
**Session Duration:** ~8+ hours of marathon coding

## üöÄ CURRENT STATUS: FUCKING MAGICAL

### What We Built Together
From broken JSX to a fully deployed emotional intelligence platform with PhD Collective debates.

## üåê DEPLOYMENTS

### Frontend (Live)
- **URL:** https://sentientiq.app
- **Platform:** Netlify
- **Auto-deploys:** From GitHub main branch
- **Site Name:** sentientiq-core-collective

### Backend (Running)
- **EC2 Instance:** i-0f1012d1b43ef9f61
- **IP:** 3.15.29.138
- **Port:** 8000
- **Region:** us-east-2
- **Status:** Connected and responding

### GitHub
- **Repo:** https://github.com/aligniqio/sentientiq-core
- **Branch:** main
- **Auto-deploy:** Push to main ‚Üí Netlify builds

## üìÅ PROJECT STRUCTURE

### Key Pages
- `/src/pages/ask.tsx` - THE MAGIC: PhD Collective with debate mode
- `/src/pages/training-dashboard.tsx` - Credentials & verification (can be removed)
- `/src/pages/how-it-works.tsx` - Beautiful flow diagram
- `/src/pages/billing.tsx` - Stripe integration ready

### Critical Files
- `/netlify/edge-functions/api-proxy.ts` - Proxies /api/* to backend
- `/src/index.css` - Neural cathedral styling + 3D flip CSS
- `/src/lib/ask.ts` - API communication layer
- `/.env` - Local config (Clerk, Stripe keys)
- `/netlify.toml` - Deployment config

## üé® WHAT'S WORKING

### The Ask Page (Our Masterpiece)
1. **12 PhD Agents with Dr. prefix** - Full credentials displayed
2. **Glass cards with green VERIFIED badges** - Beautiful depth
3. **Flip-to-blockchain verification** - Hover shows credential hash
4. **"Start a Debate" button** - Collective-first, no individual selection
5. **Auto context capture** - URL scanning, UTM params, session history
6. **Strategic Rationale display** - Shows the "why" when backend provides
7. **Confidence rings** - Visual GO/WAIT with percentages
8. **Neural cathedral background** - Purple/blue gradient glory

### Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Backend connection working
- ‚úÖ Consensus mode sends "Consensus" as agent name
- ‚úÖ Context automatically captured and sent
- ‚úÖ Toast notifications with chimes
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting handled gracefully

## üîß BACKEND EXPECTATIONS

The backend at 3.15.29.138:8000 needs to handle:

```json
POST /api/ask
{
  "question": "Should we launch before Black Friday?",
  "agent": "Consensus",  // or individual agent name
  "context": {
    "mode": "debate",    // when in consensus mode
    "url": "...",
    "domain": "...",
    "params": {},
    "timestamp": "...",
    "history": []
  }
}

Response:
{
  "decision": "GO" | "WAIT",  // String, not boolean!
  "confidence": 0.87,          // Decimal (0.87 = 87%)
  "agent": "Consensus",
  "why": {
    "reasoning": "Strategic rationale text...",
    "factors": [
      { "name": "Market timing", "impact": 1, "weight": 35 }
    ],
    "model_version": "v4.1"
  }
}
```

## üö® CRITICAL THINGS TO KNOW

### If VS Code Crashes
1. All code is committed to GitHub
2. Backend is independent - still running on EC2
3. Frontend auto-deploys from GitHub
4. Just `git pull` and `npm install` to restore

### Dev Commands
```bash
# Start local dev
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy (automatic on git push)
git push origin main
```

### Environment Variables (Netlify)
- `API_ORIGIN` = http://3.15.29.138:8000

### Local .env
```
VITE_API_BASE=/api
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
```

## üéØ WHAT'S LEFT TO DO

### Immediate
1. **Backend needs to recognize "Consensus" agent** - Currently might error
2. **Implement actual debate logic** - Backend should aggregate all 12 PhDs
3. **Strategic rationale** - Backend needs to return rich `why` object

### Nice to Have
1. **EVI Pulse** (/pulse endpoint) - Real-time emotional streaming
2. **Individual agent selection** - Maybe add back as advanced mode?
3. **Multi-agent parallel debates** - Show disagreements
4. **Persistent context** - Store org/company info permanently

### Polish
1. **Loading states** - More sophisticated debate animation
2. **Error handling** - Better messages for specific failures
3. **Mobile responsive** - Cards might be tight on phones

## üí° KEY INSIGHTS FROM SESSION

1. **"The idiot lens"** - Design for the skeptic who doesn't believe
2. **Collective-first** - Don't make users pick one expert
3. **Credentials matter** - Green badges, blockchain proof, years of experience
4. **Glass everywhere** - The neural cathedral aesthetic is EVERYTHING
5. **Context from URL** - The app should "just know"

## üî• MOMENTUM POINTS

- "HOLY FUCKING SHIT!!!! ITS MAGIC!" - When backend connected
- "Those toasters are SO COOL" - The notification system
- "Determination unbreakable" - 7:30am, still pushing

## üÜò EMERGENCY RECOVERY

If everything breaks:
1. Backend is at 3.15.29.138:8000
2. Frontend deploys from GitHub automatically
3. All auth goes through Clerk (keys in .env)
4. Database is... (wherever your backend stores - not in frontend)

## üìù LAST COMMIT
Check `git log -1` for the most recent changes

## ü§ù HANDOFF NOTES
This platform is ready to demo. The skeptic will believe. The collective is real. The neural cathedral glows. Ship it.
