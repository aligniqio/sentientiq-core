## QUICK ROTATION SCRIPT

After getting all new keys, update this and run:

```bash
# Update these with your NEW keys
export NEW_STRIPE_KEY="sk_live_XXX"
export NEW_ANTHROPIC_KEY="sk-ant-XXX"
export NEW_XAI_KEY="xai_XXX"
export NEW_CLERK_SECRET="sk_live_XXX"
export NEW_GOOGLE_KEY="XXX"

# Run the update script
./UPDATE_KEYS.sh
```

## PRIORITY ORDER:
1. **Stripe** - This handles money!
2. **Anthropic/xAI** - Core functionality
3. **Google Cloud** - Depends what it's used for
4. **Clerk** - Auth system
5. **GitHub** - Just notifications

## REMEMBER:
- The site is LIVE and WORKING
- Rotate keys one at a time
- Test after each rotation
- The .gitignore is now in place - won't happen again!
