# Orchestrator WebSocket Handoff - Post-Intervention Engine Fixes

## Current Status: INTERVENTION ENGINE WORKING! üéâ

### What We Accomplished Today
1. **Fixed Pattern Mappings** - Updated pattern-engine.ts to map correct emotions to interventions:
   - `price_shock` ‚Üí `discount_modal`
   - `confusion` ‚Üí `help_chat`
   - `cart_hesitation` ‚Üí `value_highlight`
   - And all other intervention mappings per spec

2. **Fixed WebSocket Delivery** - Modified unified-websocket.ts:
   - ALWAYS broadcasts interventions to dashboard, even without client connection
   - Dashboard now receives all intervention events for monitoring
   - Removed HTTP/2 from nginx config to enable WebSocket upgrades

3. **Fixed Environment Variables** - Deployed .env with all required keys:
   - Supabase credentials now working
   - No more "Invalid API key" errors

4. **Added Processor Metrics** - server-clean.js now broadcasts processor events:
   - Dashboard can track emotions processed
   - Metrics properly increment

## Current Issues That Need Fixing

### 1. Telemetry Contamination in Intervention Stream ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Problem**: The Intelligence Stream (intervention channel) is showing "telemetry ‚Üí behavior" events that shouldn't be there.

**What You See**: In the dashboard's Intelligence Stream:
```
telemetry ‚Üí behavior (10:32:49 PM)  ‚ùå SHOULDN'T BE HERE
engine ‚Üí intervention (help_chat)     ‚úÖ CORRECT
```

**Where to Look**:
- These events are being broadcast to the intervention channel somehow
- Check `broadcastPipelineEvent()` calls
- The contamination is NOT coming from behavior-processor.js (checked)
- The contamination is NOT from the WebSocket telemetry handler (checked)
- Need to find where "telemetry" stage events are being sent to intervention clients

### 2. Metrics Display Issues
**Working**:
- Telemetry: 4 ‚úÖ
- Engine: 2 ‚úÖ
- Processor: Will increment with new fix ‚úÖ

**Not Working**:
- WebSocket: 0 (correct until actual client connects)
- Success Rate: 0% (correct - no actual client deliveries yet)
- Avg Latency: 34638ms (WRONG - should be milliseconds not 34 seconds!)

## How the System Works Now

### Emotion ‚Üí Intervention Flow
1. **Telemetry arrives** at `/api/telemetry/stream`
2. **Processor diagnoses emotions** from telemetry events
3. **Pattern engine matches** emotions to intervention patterns
4. **Intervention broadcasts** to:
   - Dashboard (ALWAYS - for monitoring)
   - Client session (IF connected)

### Key Files Modified
- `/orchestrator/src/services/pattern-engine.ts` - Emotion-to-intervention mappings
- `/orchestrator/src/services/unified-websocket.ts` - Broadcast logic
- `/orchestrator/src/server-clean.js` - Added processor metrics
- `/etc/nginx/conf.d/api.conf` - Removed HTTP/2 for WebSocket support

## Testing Commands

### Send test emotion to trigger intervention:
```bash
curl -X POST https://api.sentientiq.app/api/emotional/event \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "session_id": "test_session",
    "tenant_id": "demo",
    "emotion": "confusion",
    "confidence": 85
  }'
```

### Check WebSocket connections:
```bash
curl https://api.sentientiq.app/api/emotional/ws-info
```

### View logs:
```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/collective-backend.pem ec2-user@98.87.12.130 \
  "pm2 logs orchestrator-clean --lines 50"
```

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: Fix Telemetry Contamination
Find where "telemetry ‚Üí behavior" events are being sent to intervention channel. They should ONLY go to a telemetry channel if anywhere.

### Priority 2: Fix Latency Calculation
The 34-second latency is clearly wrong. Find where this is calculated in the frontend and fix the math.

### Priority 3: Clean Channel Separation
Ensure complete separation:
- Emotions ‚Üí emotion channel only
- Interventions ‚Üí intervention channel only
- Telemetry ‚Üí should NOT broadcast to any dashboard channel

## Architecture Understanding

```
Telemetry Stream ‚Üí Processor ‚Üí Pattern Engine ‚Üí Intervention Engine
     ‚Üì                ‚Üì             ‚Üì                    ‚Üì
  [metrics]       [emotions]   [patterns]        [interventions]
                      ‚Üì                                ‚Üì
                Dashboard Emotion Feed    Dashboard Intervention Feed
```

## Production Server Access
```bash
ssh -i /Users/matthewkiselstein/projects/sentientiq-core/.ssh/collective-backend.pem \
  ec2-user@98.87.12.130
```

## Key Insight
The intervention system IS working! Interventions are flowing to the dashboard. The remaining issues are:
1. Channel contamination (telemetry in wrong stream)
2. Metric calculations (latency)
3. But the core emotion ‚Üí pattern ‚Üí intervention ‚Üí dashboard flow is OPERATIONAL!

Remember: "We do this part right and we change EVERYTHING!"
