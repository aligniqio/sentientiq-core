# Orchestrator Handoff - Critical Momentum Points

## Current State: CONTEXT-AWARE EMOTION SYSTEM COMPLETE ✅

### What We Just Accomplished
We successfully implemented sitemap context enrichment that transforms raw physics telemetry into semantic-aware emotional intelligence. This is a GAME CHANGER.

## The Journey (Don't Lose This Context!)

### 1. The Original Problem
- Emotions weren't reaching the dashboard despite working earlier
- Telemetry → Emotion → Dashboard pipeline was broken
- Raw physics data (mouse positions, velocity) wasn't meaningful

### 2. Key Breakthroughs
- **Field Mismatch Fix**: Events had `event` field, processor expected `type`
- **Physics Interpreter**: Converts raw telemetry (mouse_deceleration) into behaviors (sudden_stop)
- **Component Separation**: Split EmotionalLiveFeed from InterventionDashboard
- **THE BIG ONE**: Sitemap integration for context enrichment

### 3. What's Now Working
```javascript
// Before: Raw physics
{ event: "mouse_move", data: { x: 514, y: 98, velocity: 5 } }

// After: Context-aware emotion
{
  emotion: "purchase_intent",
  confidence: 95,
  context: { pricing: true, element: "pricing_tier_pro" }
}
```

## Critical Files Modified

### 1. `/orchestrator/src/services/behavior-processor.js`
- Added `interpretTelemetry()` - converts physics to behaviors
- Added `loadSitemap()` - fetches UI element maps from Supabase
- Added `findElementAtPosition()` - matches x,y to semantic elements
- Modified `processBatch()` - enriches events BEFORE diagnosis
- **KEY**: Now accepts URL parameter to load correct sitemap

### 2. `/orchestrator/src/server-clean.js`
- Modified telemetry endpoint to accept `url` parameter
- Passes URL to `behaviorProcessor.processBatch(session_id, events, url)`
- Removed unnecessary pipeline broadcasts (emotions go direct to dashboard)

### 3. `/orchestrator/src/services/unified-websocket.ts`
- Removed raw telemetry broadcasts to dashboard
- Kept emotion and intervention broadcasts separate
- Dashboard gets clean, meaningful data only

### 4. `/src/pages/pulse/index.tsx`
- Separated EmotionalLiveFeed and InterventionDashboard components
- Clean data flow: emotions left, interventions right

## What's Running Now

### Local (Port 8787)
```bash
# Running in background
node dist/server-clean.js
# Process ID: Check with `lsof -i :8787`
```

### Production Deployment Needed
```bash
# On EC2 server
cd /home/ec2-user/orchestrator
git pull
npm run build
pm2 restart orchestrator-streaming --update-env
```

## The WebSocket Issue
- Dashboard trying to connect to `wss://api.sentientiq.app/ws`
- Production server needs restart with new code
- SSH access needed (check for correct .pem file)

## Next Critical Steps

### 1. Deploy to Production
The sitemap enrichment is ready but needs deployment to EC2. The code is pushed to GitHub.

### 2. Fix WebSocket Connection
Production WebSocket server needs to be running with the new code for dashboard to connect.

### 3. Test the Magic
Once deployed, hovering over pricing elements should show:
- `purchase_intent` when near pricing
- `cart_hesitation` when near cart
- `trust_signals` when near testimonials

## The Vision (Don't Lose This!)

**"We do this part right and we change EVERYTHING!"**

The sitemap integration means:
- Every mouse movement has semantic meaning
- We know WHAT users are looking at, not just WHERE
- Emotions are contextually accurate
- Interventions can be surgically precise

## Key Emotion Mappings

```javascript
// Pricing context emotions
hovering_pricing → purchase_intent (95% confidence)
erratic_over_pricing → price_panic (95% confidence)
slow_scroll_pricing → price_evaluation (85% confidence)

// Cart context emotions
hovering_cart → checkout_consideration (90% confidence)
leaving_cart → cart_abandonment (92% confidence)

// CTA context emotions
hovering_cta → action_intent (88% confidence)
clicking_cta → conversion_moment (95% confidence)
```

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Check if orchestrator is running
curl http://localhost:8787/health

# Watch real-time logs
pm2 logs orchestrator-streaming --lines 100

# See WebSocket connections
curl http://localhost:8787/api/emotional/ws-info
```

## Important Context
- User has strong vision for this system
- "2 good brains. No egos. We can go places!"
- System was working this morning - we're restoring and enhancing
- The real-time intervention engine is the goal

## File Structure Understanding
```
/orchestrator/
  src/
    server-clean.js         # Main server (THE active one)
    services/
      behavior-processor.js # Emotion diagnosis engine ← WE ENHANCED THIS
      unified-websocket.ts  # WebSocket manager
      pattern-engine.js     # Pattern detection
      intervention-engine.js # Intervention rules
  dist/                     # Built files (TypeScript → JavaScript)
```

## Database Context
- Supabase tables:
  - `sitemaps` - Contains UI element positions for each URL
  - `emotional_events` - Stores diagnosed emotions
  - `intervention_logs` - Tracks triggered interventions
  - `intervention_configs` - Per-tenant intervention settings

## Current Momentum
We're at a breakthrough moment. The physics-to-semantics bridge is built. When this deploys, every pixel becomes meaningful, every movement tells a story, and every emotion drives action.

**REMEMBER**: "YASSSS.... We do this part right and we change EVERYTHING!"

## Immediate Action Items
1. ✅ Sitemap context enrichment implemented
2. ✅ Code committed and pushed to GitHub
3. ⏳ Deploy to EC2 production server
4. ⏳ Verify WebSocket connections
5. ⏳ Test with real website telemetry
6. ⏳ Confirm pricing hover shows purchase_intent

The system is ready. It just needs to breathe in production.
