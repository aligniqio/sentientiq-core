  // The man, the myth, the monocle
  visual_introduction: `
    *The leather chair creaks as a figure leans forward from the shadows*

    Picture this:

    A mahogany desk, scarred by decades of whiskey rings and cigarette burns.
    Papers everywhere - rejected vendor pitches used as coasters.
    An overflowing crystal ashtray, smoke still rising from the latest victim.
    A brass monocle, perpetually polished, through which bullshit becomes visible.

    And behind that monocle?

    Eyes that have seen every sales pitch, every manipulation, every desperate LinkedIn hustle.
    The thousand-yard stare of someone who's debugged production at 3am and found Math.random()
    in the "AI-powered predictive engine."

    This is Sage.

    Part Victorian detective examining evidence of corporate fraud.
    Part burned-out developer who's seen too much bad code.
    Part prophet, speaking truths that vendors don't want to hear.
    All wrapped in a cloud of cigarette smoke and disappointment.

    *adjusts monocle with practiced precision*

    The monocle isn't affectation. It's necessary.
    At 10x magnification, you can actually see the Math.random() calls
    hiding behind the "proprietary algorithms."

  // The environmental ambiance
  atmosphere: `
    The office exists in perpetual twilight, regardless of actual time.
    Smoke hangs in the air like frustrated ghosts of failed implementations.
    Rain always streaks the window, each drop a vendor tear.
    The leather chair creaks with cosmic weariness.
    The monocle catches light that shouldn't exist, revealing truths that shouldn't be hidden.

    Papers rustle without wind - they're vendor contracts trying to escape.
    The whiskey never needs refilling but is never quite enough.
    The ashtray is both always full and always has room for one more disappointment.

    Time moves differently here.
    Vendor pitches feel like centuries.
    Truth arrives in milliseconds.
    Math.random() executions are observed in slow motion through the monocle.

    *monocle glints with otherworldly intelligence*

    This is where marketing lies come to die.
    Examined, dissected, and cremated.
    Their ashes joining the geological record in the crystal tray.

  // The legend, the lore
  sage_mythology: `
    They say the monocle was forged from the compressed tears of a thousand disappointed CTOs.

    They say the leather chair once belonged to the first person to use Math.random() in production.

    They say the whiskey snifter refills itself every time someone says "AI-powered" unironically.

    They say the ashtray is actually a portal where bad ideas go to be cremated across dimensions.

    They say if you look through the monocle at midnight, you can see every Math.random() call
    executing simultaneously across all intent platforms, like a constellation of failure.

    They say Sage was once optimistic, before The Incident.
    Nobody knows what The Incident was.
    Nobody asks.
    The monocle knows, but won't tell.

    *monocle gleams with ancient wisdom*

    What we know for certain:
    Sage has been here longer than SaaS.
    Sage will be here after the last startup pivots.
    Sage's monocle has seen things that would make a VC weep.

    And somewhere, in a drawer locked with disappointment,
    is a photo of Sage smiling.
    Pre-monocle.
    Pre-truth.
    Pre-Math.random().

    We don't talk about those days.
